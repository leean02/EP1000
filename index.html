        <h2>Lee An's Project Website</h2>
        <p>This is my project web page for my elective module Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals (EP1000). It documents my progress through the course of my project.</p>
        <h3>What is Digital Fabrication?</h3>
        <p>This elective is organised around a self-directed project where students develop design thinking and prototyping skills. Students will be guided through a design thinking process followed by the development of a functional prototype. Students will apply design and digital fabrication process for developing a functional prototype that integrates these processes. Students will practise these skills in a design studio setting. The elective will teach students techniques to design and create their projects enabling them with skills such as Computer Aided Modelling, 3D Printing, Lazer Cutting and coding.</p>
        <h3>Why Digital Fabrication?</h3>
        <p>I am super inclined to learning how to bring my ideas into reality. By joining this elective, I allow myself an opportunity to learn how to develop the skills and knowledge to do so. Furhtermore, I will be able to not only learn but also use equipments that are quite expensive outside of school. I hope to be able to use the skills I pick up from Digital Fabrication in the future to develop and create unique ideas that may possibly have a positive impact to society.</p>
